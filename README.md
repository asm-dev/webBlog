# webBlog
 Full Stack App [ Angular & Express ]

#1. First of all use [ git clone {url for the repo} ] to clone the repo on your machine.

#2. change directory inside each folder and run npm install, there is only two folders in this repo.

#3. cd into serve folder --> routes --> api.js --> and change the mongodb url to one that fits yours.

#4. still in server folder run npm run dev >> port running on http://localhost:3000.

#5. cd into ngApp folder and run ng serve >> port running on http://localhost:4200.

#6. you will see a blank page thats because you don't have any blog into your DB, so after connecting the app to your mongodb url as we mention in the row #3 on the navbar go to add blog and add blog data.

#7. IMPORTANT: when you are adding blog in the addblog/ router make sure all the image fields must be links to outside images i.e: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586227740560-8cf2732c1531?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDF8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1922&q=80 .

#8. see your blog in the blogs router

Done.
